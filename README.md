## What it does

It can work with both rear camera as well as  front camera.. the first thing you would see is a custom instruction saying smile. This shows the image of the moment as GIF in the camera to make your imagination more natural and effective when clicked.

## How I built it
I collected large assets of images in png format. We used them in particle emitter, l  .I added background to make contrast.  Then added functionality to the face tracker, background effect with the help of Spark AR.

## Challenges I ran into

For patching it seems difficult. Lots of things get conflicted while building. Detection of things was no so easy to detect, we need to take care of eyebrow movement, eyes opening closing etc.   (Large images was deleted because of the large export size)

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I worked in this project from starting of this month(September) but unfortunately(Health issue) got delayed and completed on the last hour of last day. I need to build something as an open source contributor towards organization to develop skills more strengthening.

## What I learned

It was quite interesting 

## What's next for Scripto

Well, we have planned to make this filter more variant, we would be adding support for more facial expression, so more people can express them self as anime and emojis.
